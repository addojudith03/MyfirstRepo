One of the most valuable things I’ve learned so far in this course is how to work with Git and GitHub to manage my projects. I now understand how to create repositories, make commits, work with branches, and collaborate using pull requests. These skills have helped me become more organized and confident when handling code changes. Learning version control has also shown me how important it is in real-world software development, especially when working as part of a team.
